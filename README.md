# primordial-dotfiles
My first ever dotfiles! I dread the day that my PC refuses to boot anymore because I've messed with too many aspects that I shouldn't be messing with. So I'm gonna introduce version control to my setup! A lot of what you see here will look sloppy and jerry-rigged, but this is my first attempt at ricing AND using Linux so have mercy.

I'm not claiming I created everything from scratch. Much of it has taken heavy inspiration from sources all over the shop.

The entire thing is designed so that whenever I set up another Arch system, I can just copy bit's and bobs from here instead of having to reinvent the wheel. It's designed with a rather large monitor in mind, but I've also tested bits on my laptop and they seem to look good there too.

Rofi app menu and the power menu are to my liking. Just need to apply a colour scheme to it, but this is no priority.

**To Do:**
- Figure out a way to centralise colour schemes.
- Make a way to interact with music a lot easier.
- Make a way to set up Wi-Fi easier.
- Replace blueman-applet

# primordial-dotfiles
My first ever dotfiles! I dread the day that my PC refuses to boot anymore because I've messed with too many aspects that I shouldn't be messing with. So I'm gonna introduce version control to my setup! A lot of what you see here will look sloppy and jerry-rigged, but this is my first attempt at ricing AND using Linux so have mercy.
